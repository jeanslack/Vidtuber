========================================
Purpose of the YT-DLP directory
========================================

This directory was created to satisfy the portability needs, for example when
the whole application is self-contained in a bundle.

In the most typical common cases a portable application can be moved between a
directory and another (see pen-drive, external hard-drive on different PC
workstations, etc). On Vidtuber this would imply resetting the paths to the
yt-dlp executable making portability inconvenient.

You can include here the yt-dlp executable to be used on
multiple PC workstations with the same platform without having to reset the
executable paths each time.

Note that Vidtuber will tend to give priority to the executables included in
your OS environment variables, but you can still set once and for all the
executables included in this location from the preferences dialog
(see Preferences --> yt-dlp tab).

To use this approach, make sure this directory tree looks like this:

|--------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
|   **Linux/FreeBSD**      |       **Windows**       |       **MACOS**
|--------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
                           |                         |
        YT-DLP             |    YT-DLP               |     YT-DLP
        |-- bin            |    |__ bin              |     |__ bin
        |   |__ yt-dlp     |    |   |__ yt-dlp.exe   |     |   |__ yt-dlp_macos
                           |                         |
